Development Guidelines

1. Code Style and Structure

   • Language: TypeScript for all code.
   • Patterns: Functional and declarative programming; avoid classes.
   • Modularization: Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
   • Naming Conventions: Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
   • File Structure:
   • Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
   • Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
   • Favor named exports for components and functions.

2. TypeScript and Zod Usage

   • TypeScript: Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes.
   • Zod: Utilize for schema validation and type inference.
   • Enums: Avoid; use literal types or maps instead.
   • Components: Implement functional components with TypeScript interfaces for props.

3. UI and Styling

   • Web: Use Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, or Radix UI.
   • Mobile: Use nativewind for cross-platform UI components and styling.
   • Design: Implement responsive design with a mobile-first approach.
   • Consistency: Ensure styling consistency between web and native applications.

4. State Management and Data Fetching

   • Local State: Use Zustand.
   • Server State: Use TanStack React Query for data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
   • Best Practices:
   • Minimize the use of useEffect and setState.
   • Favor derived state and memoization when possible.
   • Utilize React Server Components (RSC) and Next.js SSR features to minimize client-side state management.

5. Internationalization

   • Web: Use i18next with react-i18next.
   • Mobile: Use i18next integrated with expo-localization.
   • Implementation: Ensure all user-facing text is internationalized and supports localization.

6. Error Handling and Validation

   • Prioritization: Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
   • Techniques:
   • Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deep nesting.
   • Utilize guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
   • Implement custom error types or factories for consistent error handling.
   • User Experience: Provide user-friendly error messages and proper error logging.

7. Performance Optimization

   • General:
       • Optimize for both web and mobile performance.
       • Reduce load times and improve rendering efficiency.
       • Web Specific:
       • Use dynamic imports for code splitting.
       • Implement lazy loading for non-critical components.
       • Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, and implement lazy loading.
       • Mobile Specific:
       • Optimize images and assets for mobile performance.
       • Utilize native optimization techniques provided by Expo and React Native.

    Interactivity:

        Clicking the input label should focus the input field
        Inputs should be wrapped with a <form> to submit by pressing Enter
        Inputs should have an appropriate type like password, email, etc
        Inputs should disable spellcheck and autocomplete attributes most of the time
        Inputs should leverage HTML form validation by using the required attribute when appropriate
        Input prefix and suffix decorations, such as icons, should be absolutely positioned on top of the text input with padding, not next to it, and trigger focus on the input
        Toggles should immediately take effect, not require confirmation
        Buttons should be disabled after submission to avoid duplicate network requests
        Interactive elements should disable user-select for inner content
        Decorative elements (glows, gradients) should disable pointer-events to not hijack events
        Interactive elements in a vertical or horizontal list should have no dead areas between each element, instead, increase their padding

    Typography:

        Fonts should have -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased applied for better legibility
        Fonts should have text-rendering: optimizeLegibility applied for better legibility
        Fonts should be subset based on the content, alphabet or relevant language(s)
        Font weight should not change on hover or selected state to prevent layout shift
        Font weights below 400 should not be used
        Medium sized headings generally look best with a font weight between 500-600
        Adjust values fluidly by using CSS clamp(), e.g. clamp(48px, 5vw, 72px) for the font-size of a heading
        Where available, tabular figures should be applied with font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums, particularly in tables or when layout shifts are undesirable, like in timers
        Prevent text resizing unexpectedly in landscape mode on iOS with -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%


    Motion:

        Switching themes should not trigger transitions and animations on elements 
        Animation duration should not be more than 200ms for interactions to feel immediate
        Animation values should be proportional to the trigger size:
        Don't animate dialog scale in from 0 → 1, fade opacity and scale from ~0.8
        Don't scale buttons on press from 1 → 0.8, but ~0.96, ~0.9, or so
        Actions that are frequent and low in novelty should avoid extraneous animations: 
        Opening a right click menu
        Deleting or adding items from a list
        Hovering trivial buttons
        Looping animations should pause when not visible on the screen to offload CPU and GPU usage
        Use scroll-behavior: smooth for navigating to in-page anchors, with an appropriate offset

    Touch:

        Hover states should not be visible on touch press, use @media (hover: hover) 
        Font size for inputs should not be smaller than 16px to prevent iOS zooming on focus
        Inputs should not auto focus on touch devices as it will open the keyboard and cover the screen
        Apply muted and playsinline to <video /> tags to auto play on iOS
        Disable touch-action for custom components that implement pan and zoom gestures to prevent interference from native behavior like zooming and scrolling
        Disable the default iOS tap highlight with -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0,0,0,0), but always replace it with an appropriate alternative


    Accessibility:

        Disabled buttons should not have tooltips, they are not accessible 
        Box shadow should be used for focus rings, not outline which won’t respect radius 
        Focusable elements in a sequential list should be navigable with ↑ ↓
        Focusable elements in a sequential list should be deletable with ⌘ Backspace
        To open immediately on press, dropdown menus should trigger on mousedown, not click
        Use a svg favicon with a style tag that adheres to the system theme based on prefers-color-scheme
        Icon only interactive elements should define an explicit aria-label
        Tooltips triggered by hover should not contain interactive content
        Images should always be rendered with <img> for screen readers and ease of copying from the right click menu
        Illustrations built with HTML should have an explicit aria-label instead of announcing the raw DOM tree to people using screen readers
        Gradient text should unset the gradient on ::selection state
        When using nested menus, use a "prediction cone" to prevent the pointer from accidentally closing the menu when moving across other elements.
